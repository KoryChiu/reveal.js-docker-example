## This slide is not printed

Because of `excludeLocation="print-pdf"` in `index.html`.
The other way round also works, using `includeLocation`.
`location` is evaluated as regex!
See [index.html](https://github.com/cloudogu/reveal.js-docker/blob/master/index.html) for implementation details.

See [print view](?print-pdf#/)

BTW To hide parts of a slide in printing use `class="state-background"`.
